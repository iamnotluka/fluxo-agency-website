						<p>Dear person exploring our very own website,</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>
							From the tech trenches of Amazon to the cutting edge of digital marketing, my obsession has always been
							about one thing: optimisation.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Not just tweaking systems, but igniting real, measurable and explosive growth.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							At Amazon, as a software engineer, I was one of the people untangling complex problems. All while being
							surrounded by genius product oriented people thinking from the customers perspective like our lives depend
							on it.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It was an amazing time, yet something was missing. I wanted to blend the precision of data and algorithms
							with the nuances of human psychology.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>That's when I discovered the magic of paid ads.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It was like alchemy - the mix of right elements: deploy, watch the data, tweak and behold a steady stream
							of leads and sales.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Sounds too good to be true? Unfortunatelly...</p>
						<br />
						<p>Let me pain a picture:</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							You've launched a campaign for a client in the home improvement niche, roofing to be exact. It's a Monday
							morning, coffee in hand, you click “Publish” on the ads.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							That buggy Meta Ads Platform screen refreshes and you see a little “Active” sign along your campaigns.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Sooner or later leads start trickling in. So far, so good.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Two weeks in, you've netted your client 21 leads on a $500 ad spend. You look at your clients CRM and he's
							already done 5 quotes, $85,000 in the pipeline from the modest investment.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							To your surprise, instead of a mild praise - you get a frustrated response from the client who is strictly
							focused only on the upfront cost - even though just one of the deals going through would result in him
							covering the marketing expenses for next 6 months.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Sounds familiar? Parhaps confusing? Don't worry. I was confused as well.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							However, this is something every agency owner had to deal with and for most of us, this was the eureka
							moment:
						</p>
						<br />
						<p className="font-bold">
							Paid ads are gold, but only if your entire sales engine is firing on all cylinders. Otherwise, it's like
							pouring your budget into a black hole.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>I realised the missing piece: consulting on sales and building robust sales systems.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							But most often, by the time everything clicked, clients were out of the door, leaving a trail of missed
							opportunities and harsh reviews.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							This realisation wasn't just about clients work. Scaling my own agency, I faced the same hurdles. Great
							leads were coming in, but reliance on ad spend was a constant thorn on my side.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>That's when I hit the wall.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I pondered a pivot, but the usual retainer models with their lofty promises and guarantees - just weren't
							for me.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I worked stricly comission based. I knew I could deliver, I just needed clients who were ready to meet me
							halfway. I needed to be more than a service provider, I needed to be a partner in true success.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>And then, the lightbulb moment:</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							What outreach method works without having to spend little to no money at all? <br></br>
							<strong>
								<br /> What if we are able to cut the ad spend all together!?
							</strong>
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Enter email marketing. <br />
							<br />
							Yes, emails. <br />
							<br />
							Direct, potent and precise.
							<br />
							<br />A way to connect directly with those who need you the most, without the scattergun approach of paid
							ads and reliance on Meta's or Googles algorithms.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Imagine a system where we can do this at scale.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Turns out, there is a way to do it. Building a system that just works and scaling it without breaking the
							bank.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>30,000 personalised emails vs $500 ad budget. Think about it for a second.</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I challenge you: Try reaching out to 30,000 businesses with a well-crafted cold email. I bet you'll book
							at least 60 sales meetings. If not, I owe you a coffee and a ham and cheese toaste (I'm serious).
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							That's how <strong>fluxo</strong> came to life. <br />
							<br></br>We partner with driven and ambitious agencies with real results and help them overcome the hurdle
							we had to face ourselves. From outreach, offers to sales, we are equiped to tackle any problem you throw
							at us. <br />
							<br />
							And yes, we still work strictly on a pey-per-result basis. Why? Because we can.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It's not just about overcoming the challenges we faced, it's about empowering you to do what you do the
							best, by doing what we do the best.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Ready to chat? <br />
							<br />
							We're eager to learn about your journey and explore how we can propel you forward.
						</p>
						<br></br>
						Best,<br></br>
